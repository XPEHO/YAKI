## Environment variables

**application.properties**

The `application.properties` file provides a template for creating an environment configuration file. It contains a list of environment variables and their default values, which can be used as a starting point for creating a `application.properties` file.

The `application.properties` file is used to store sensitive information and other configuration settings that should not be hard-coded in the application code. We recommend that you copy `application.properties.sample` to `application.properties` and customize it with your own configuration settings.

**env.sample**

The `env.sample` file provides a template for creating an environment configuration file. It contains a list of environment variables and their default values, which can be used as a starting point for creating a `.env` file.

The `.env` file is used to store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other configuration settings that should not be hard-coded in the application code. We recommend that you copy `env.sample` to `.env` and customize it with your own configuration settings.
